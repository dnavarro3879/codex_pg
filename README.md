# Rare Bird Finder

A small example project with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend. It queries
the eBird API for notable sightings near a user-provided location.

## Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI application.
- `frontend/`: Next.js + Tailwind UI.

This is a minimal skeleton intended for customization.
